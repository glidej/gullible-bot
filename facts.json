				"You are a bunch of rowdy bumpkins.  And some of you are presumptuous to boot.For example: one rude fellow named Doug wrote in to sayHere is a factoid for gullible.info. If current trends continue gullible.info will change their website TWICE A YEAR!Another chap named \"Opus\" decided to sayWhat's with this site?  Do you ever actually update things?  I'm finished. Off my daily list it goes.  I don't need a website taking up my time for nothing.Well fine, you've all made your point.  Here's what I sent out to the email list on September 20, 2005.  In retrospect, I should have posted it on the site, too.Guess what!  I've been a stranger for the last month or so, and for that I am sorry.  But other than apologies, I come with some exciting news: today is the one year anniversary of Gullible.info.  We started this site way back in September 20, 2004.As you've probably noticed, the daily format has taken its toll.  The ideas that once came effortlessly to me are now the product of forced, measured creativity and conscious effort.  Not that there's nothing wrong with that; forced creativity is important to keep one's mind keen.  But at the moment, I don't have the sort of time to dedicate to this project in the form that it has been in for the last year.Is this the end of Gullible.info?  HECK NO!  I've registered the domain name for several more years, and I plan on making full use of it until the name expires, then I plan on reregistering it.  I think of Gullible.info as my flagship project, and I don't ever want to see its demise.  What will change, though, is the format and the content.No longer will Gullible.info have a daily format.  It's too taxing on my writers, and as I explained, I can no longer adequately pick up the slack.  Instead now our updates will be sporadic, coming when an author feels the motivation to make an update.  This may be once a week, it may also be more or less frequent.  My suggestion, subscribe to the , and you'll never have to worry about another thing in your precious little lives.Gullible.info isn't going to shrink.  We'll still keep up our full year of archived updates and we'll be adding to those when we can.  Moreover, we are in the process of rolling out a new feature of the site, \"Ask Gullible.info.\"Do you have a question that's been bugging you, and you want to just find out a good old-fashioned, down-home country answer, just like mom used to make?  We're here to do it for you.  Send your questions to  and if we use your question, you'll get a pat on the back and the satisfaction of a job well done.What about the daily emails, you ask.

				"Grails Throughout HistorySince the advent of Christianity two millenia ago, believers have searched for what is perceived by many to be the single most valuable religious artifact in the history of the world: The Grail of Jesus Christ. The Grail was believed to be a cup, bowl, or other vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper, and was said to possess supernatural powers. According to the legend, it was used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch the blood of Christ during the crucifixion, and was then spirited away to a fate unknown. A number of grails have surfaced throughout history since that time. Among them:305: A self-proclaimed Turkish prophet named Cemaletin lead a revolt of roughly 8000 against the Byzantine occupation of what is now Antolia. He rallied his supporters through the promise of immortality and worldly knowledge, which he claimed he gained from a mysterious goblet he carried on his person at all times. The revolt was swiftly crushed after only three days of open conflict, and Cemaletin was run through with a cavalry lance. The cup believed to be hanging from a band around his neck was never found.563: Visigothic prince Zabithelguld lead a successful twilight attack against Byzantine garrisons at Ravenna, Italy, with less than 70 soldiers. A scribe to the Viceroy of Ravenna wrote in his journal \"[the Goths] fight as if an unseen hand defends them. Arrows turn aside at their approach, swords blunt, and spears are as if made of straw. [Other people] say they have the blood of the Christ on their side, and I fear we cannot prevail against Barbarians of the cup of God.\" The Gothic force barricaded themselves inside the garrison, and remained inside for thirteen days without food or water. On the thirteenth day, the invaders emerged under a flag of truce to negotiate safe passage out of the province, they were captured and hanged. Neither the body of Zabithelguld nor his mythic cup were ever recovered.1215: A sect of Cornish monks in exile in Normandy locked themselves in their monastery and set it ablaze shortly after receiving what monastic journals recovered from the fire described as a \"goblet of great value\". A letter written by the abbot to the Count of Normandy shortly before the fire stated that \"[we] have drunk from the cup of righteousness with the name of the Lord upon our lips, and so should our wounds be cleansed and shall we live eternally.\" No one in the Count's court spoke Cornish, and the letter remained untranslated until 1633.1364: Thirteen members of the family of Serbian Tsar Stefan Uroš V were killed in a squabble when the Grand Duke (the Tsar's nephew) was suspected of possessing the Grail. Serbian historians believe the thirteen murders were carried out by Uroš' cousin Tvrtko of Bosnia to clear his way to the throne once he obtained the grail.1771: An armed historian named Joseph Pippleshire attempted to rob the Royal Treasury of British monarch George III, believing the Grail to be inside. He managed to reach the treasure chamber, but his daring heist ended abruptly when he recognized the chalice he sought as the goblet of King Ethelred the Unready (968-1016), and threw himself on his sword.1945: On April 20th, mere days before the capture of Berlin by the Soviet army in the second world war, Adolf Hitler issued a personal communique to Josef Stalin, the Soviet premier, informing him that his government possessed the Grail and warning his army not to challenge the \"invincible armies of Germany, [such as] have not been seen since the days of Barbarossa.\" Stalin found this letter so amusing that he had his personal secretary distribute copies of it to senior party officials. Three resigned over Stalin's \"obvious and unprofessional prank\", and were summarily executed."

				"Basque, And Ye Shall ReceiveThe inspiration for today's article comes from an e-mail from Elizabeth Cohen of Yellow Springs, Ohio. Elizabeth writes:Dear Zack,What can you tell us about the Basques?Well Elizabeth, as most of our readers already know the Basques are an ethnic group indigenous to the western Pyrenees mountains. Their country is split between France and Spain, with the mountains forming the border between the two halves. They play over 40 variations of a game called \"Pelota\", ranging from Jai-Alai games like Cesta Punta to Raquetball games like Pala. Basques speak their own language, which they call \"Euskara\" (literally Basque for \"way of speaking\"), and it is unrelated to any other language in the world. The Basque genome is an elusive one, believing to have north African origin, in what is now northwest Libya. The closest living relatives of the Basque people are the Elan, a nomadic tribe of Mizrahi Jews inhabiting the Egyptian steppe. Basques are nine times more likely than their French and Spanish neighbors to develop rheumatoid arthritis, and one third as likely to develop gout or astigmatism.It is believed that the Basques were the first proponents of organized games of chance, after a primitive casino consisting only of dice games was unearthed during a dig in Lapourd in 1923.More Basques live in hillside villages and towns than do any other group anywhere else in the world, with the exception of Mongolia. After numerous incursions into Basque territory in the early 14th century, King Eneko III grew tired of waiting to return to his palace at Pamplona and had another built into a hillside in Aquitane. Since then, more and more settlements emerged on hills, until as of 2003 the area of 137 of the estimated 155 major Basque villages are build on terrain that is 51 percent hills. Only 11 exist on flat land.More hats are manufactured by hand in the seven district of the Basque Country  than anywhere else in the world. Five out of every seven hats produced are black.Basques were one of the first European groups to discover surfing, with the slowly sloping beaches on the Bay of Biscay providing excellent wave height. Basques surfed year-round on very flat teardrop-shaped boards as early as 950, and at least one Basque monarch is believed to have died while surfing. The word for this activity in Basque is \"Urmugitukara\", or \"way of moving on water\".The Basque language has more Xs per sentence than any other language using the roman alphabet (Highland Siberian has a more frequent occurrence of the X sound, but it is represented by a different Cyrillic letter).The Basque region of Bizkaia (Biscay) is home to the oldest instance of Parliamentary Democracy. In 1125, a group of village elders banded together with the common goal of limiting the power of King Ieffa II. They demanded an audience at the royal palace alone, and were never heard from again.Further recommended reading:A Brief History of the Basque Country, Michael Glass (1973)Euskal Herria, or A Hiking Tour of Europe's Best Kept Secret, Brian Dreher (1989)Euskal Like Me: One Basque's Return Voyage, Xare Hernani (1992)"

				"Lost in TranslationWhen the people of the world speak as many languages as we do, things are bound to get a little garbled as they make their way around the globe. A number of notable examples of  modern popular mythos have been altered significantly during their integrations into foreign cultures, and here are a few examples for your enlightenment:Due to popular demand for the film but governmental concern over its message, George Lucas's Star Wars was redubbed and recut by the Soviet Ministry of Information in 1981. In this altered version, Luke is reluctant to resist the Empire because he knows that their goals are virtuous, but is strongarmed into it by a conniving and cowardly Obi-Wan Kenobi, who commits suicide at the hands of Darth Vader rather than lead the rebellion against the Empire himself. Luke finally becomes indoctrinated, and leads an attack run against the Death Star, from which he does not return. The final shot of the film is of four additional Death Stars, and the implication of many more, underscoring the futility of Luke's fight against a government whose only goal is to protect its citizens. Interestingly, the name of this loving empire's weapon remains more or less unchanged, translating roughly to \"Star of Murder\".Similarly, Austrian Neo-Nazis screened in 1979 an altered version of \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?\", edited to underscore their belief in the genetic inferiority of blacks. This was mostly illustrated through editing of Sidney Poitier's scenes to make him appear to have awkward table manners.Being one of the most popular films in history, \"Gone With The Wind\" has been dubbed in 23 different languages, and subtitled in over 80. As such, one of its most famous lines has been somewhat convoluted throughout the years:Javanese: With honesty, Scarlett, I do not care at all. (Indonesia)English (Singaporean): Frankly, my dear, I am indifferent. (Though Singapore's official language is English, Singaporean law prohibits verbal profanity of any kind in film. Therefore, an additional dub was required to secure a national release.)Flemish: Truthfully, my beloved, I don't give two damns. (Belgium)Hazara: Honestly, I cannot care. (Afghanistan)Somali: Very frankly, dearest, I do not give a damn. (Somalia)Russian: Truthfully, I cannot give you beans. (Russia. To \"give beans\" is a russian idiom meaning \"to care deeply\".)The Bill Murray film \"Groundhog Day\" is believed to be a holy resource in Nepal, and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile considers it a \"divinely inspirational reflection on the cyclical nature of existence\". The film is subsequently banned in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.Although his works have been successfully translated into a number of European and Asian languages, only three editions exist of Stephen King novels translated into African dialects. This is due to the unusually large number of noun classes possessed by many African languages. \"The Shining\" is an example, wherein the titular object (an ability of extrasensory perception) does not conform to the noun classes found in Bagu, in which all things are either vapors, liquids, plants, four-legged animals, and other animals. Despite its popularity in much of Central and South America, the television show \"Cheers\" is not shown in Chile or Peru, as the most of the main characters' names (Cliff, Norm, and Carla, among others) are all profanities in the indigenous Incaic languages."

				"By The NumbersSince the concept of number and quantity entered the analytical mind of man, various numbers have been considered to be \"lucky\" and \"unlucky\". In the United States the number 13 is considered unlucky for a myriad of reasons dating back to biblical times (thirteen people were present at the Last Supper, for example). As a result many old buildings do not have a thirteenth floor, preferring to name the floor after the twelfth floor the fourteenth. On the other hand, the number seven is considered to be \"lucky\". There are seven days in a week, seven sacraments, seven sister colleges (Wellesley, Barnard, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Radcliffe, and Bryn Mawr), and seven is the most likely sum to arise from the roll of two dice (though this is a losing roll in craps, making it decidedly unlucky).Every culture has their own set of popular superstition, and a unique set of lucky and unlucky numbers:In Egyptian culture, 4,223 was an unlucky number because of the pictograms required to represent it (four thousand, two hundred, fifteen, and eight). When placed together, these pictograms presented a crude representation of a scene that could be interpreted as the murder of a young Pharaoh. This superstition fell into disuse with the conquer of the 26th dynasty and the acceptance of a base-ten system in the ninth century.2 is considered an lucky number to both Greeks and Russians, as monarchs bearing that regnal number tended to be wise and benevolent. Similarly, 4 is considered unlucky number in Russian folklore (due largely to Ivan IV Vasilyevich, better known as Ivan the Terrible).1605 is a lucky number in England and much of Great Britain, being the year Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot to destroy the houses of Parliament failed. It is considered a supremely unlucky year for the Basques, as it was the year Henry III of France began the persecution of Basque orthodox christians and pagans.7 was declared to be an unlucky number by King George III of Britain shortly before his death, because \"it keeps showing up!\" Interestingly, the King was officially declared insane and locked within Windsor Castle on July the Seventh, 1811.The Persian mathematician al-Kwarizmi considered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31 to be unlucky, due to their nature as prime numbers. However, 6, 28, 496, and 8128 were lucky, as they are \"perfect numbers\" (numbers whose divisors add up to the number: 1 x2 x 3=6, and 1+2+3=6)."

				"Observations On ObfuscationCamouflage has come a long way since the dawn of organized warfare. From the sand-colored uniforms of the Ancient Greeks, to the forest costumes of the Celts, to modern urban uniforms that can render a subject virtually invisible on a city street, camouflage has become an integral part of conflict. Here are some parts of its illustrious history of which you might not be aware:The word Camouflage comes from the Ancient Persian phrase Kam Uflaz, meaning \"we are attacked [by] the land\". This phrase came into use after Saracen convoys were repeatedly attacked by bandits in northwest India who disguised themselves as piles of dirt. After the discovery of a listening device disguised as a rock outside the Russian embassy in London, Russian authorities removed and destroyed rocks near embassies in 26 countries. It is not known if these rocks contained anything out of the ordinary.During the US Airspace lock-down of 1962 prohibiting passenger travel by air, a Hungarian agent managed to reach US soil by disguising himself as a box of powdered mashed potatoes. He was discovered and captured when customs officers noticed two boxes of powdered potatoes in the hold, but only one on the manifest.One hundred and sixty cow suits were manufactured by a Pennsylvania defense contractor for use by the SAS and OSS in surveillance of the French countryside, but were never used. It seemed the firm had modeled the suits after the pattern of the Dutch Belt breed of bovine common in Pennsylvania, while the species prevalent in France's farmland was the mottled Holstein variety.Due to the light reflection of British Viridian Heather, it is very hard to blend into. For this reason, 18th century tacticians planted as much of it as they could all over Europe. It is believed that over 50 other species of low-lying plants became extinct as a result.After reading Shakespeare's Macbeth, King Charles I ordered all troops fighting in areas bordered by woodland to carry a tree branch to act as camouflage. Charles vastly overestimated his troops' ability to confuse the enemy, and countless slowed and weakened British legions were cut to pieces by Irish archers at the comparatively minor skirmish at Dunhamshire, 1632."

				"Gas AttackCarbon dioxide emissions account for a majority of greenhouse gas accumulating in the atmosphere, with CO2 comprising 365 parts per million of atmospheric gases. Almost all of these emissions are produced in the areas of power generation, heavy industry, commercial activity, and transportation, these four areas making up 99.5% of all carbon dioxide emissions. The remaining .5% of emissions come from a myriad of unusual and unexpected sources. A few examples:Food Preparation: Baking, grilling, broiling, deep frying, braising, and other forms of hot food preparation account for .00039% of CO2 emissions. The cleanest method of cooking is sauteeing using sesame oil, releasing an average of 110 micrograms of CO2 per dish sauteed. Grilling with charcoal and lighter fluid is considered to be the most emitting method, with the average hamburger requiring the release of 1350 micrograms to be \"well done\".Fireworks Displays: The human love of celebratory explosives makes up .0000063% of global carbon dioxide. Over twenty-two kilos of the gas entered the atmosphere this past July Fourth, with the Grucci and Company display over New York City making up for almost a third of that (seven kilos). Disney Land and Disney World emit an average of four kilos of CO2 in their daily fireworks displays, more than every car in the parking lot would produce in a week.Bonfires: Burning leaves, scrap wood, and other flammables are responsible for .0000029% of greenhouse gas emission. The average rural American town will produce more CO2 from the tailpipes of their tractors during one day of the harvest than they will in bonfires for the rest of the year.Tobacco Smoke: The burning of tobacco in cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and other forms accounts for .0000032% of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. It is estimated that the use of filters in most commercial cigarette brands decrease this amount by at least half. Though it has only eleven million residents, Cuba produces one and a half times as much CO2 from Tobacco as California, whose smoking laws are the strictest in the United States.Space Flight: Contrary to popular belief, Space Flight does indeed contribute to CO2 levels. Although most launch fuel is liquid oxygen, the intense heat of the exhaust has a profound effect on atmospheric aerosol hydrocarbons as the spacecraft passes through the ionosphere, breaking them down into carbons dioxide and monoxide. This contributes to roughly .000000000823% of atmospheric CO2."

				"An open letter to the fans and friends of Gullible.info and Stephen Colbert:Today, our hearts beat reluctantly, weighted by the burden of a shameful failure and bound by the chains of a deception gone awry.  It is unfortunate that we are writing this in the midst of what has been a fantastic year for everyone's favorite \"trivia destination\": Readership is up 12 times from what it was this time last year, and our  is now installed on 18 percent of all .  Yes, if it weren't for a few recently transpired events, this may have very well been a day of celebration.  Instead, it is a bitter time of self-loathing and tears.However, you might still be as unaware of the situation as all of us here at Gullible.info were until a few days ago; we will elaborate.Here at Gullible.info we pride ourselves on being a clearing house for fascinating and tantalizing tidbits. In a word: trivia!  Early last month, our automated fact extracting system found a fascinating bit of information from a TV broadcast, The Colbert Report: \"The elephant population has tripled in the last six months.\"  Needless to say, this piqued our interests.  After a quick trip to Wikipedia to verify its authenticity, the \"fact\" was queued up to run on August 24, 2006.It was only later that we learned from our diligent readers that the elephant population had not tripled in the last six months.  What's more, it would be physically impossible for this to happen, given the long gestation periods of pachyderms.Naturally we were shocked, as you must be, too.  How could we have made such an egregious mistake?  The answer it turns out, was far more sinister than just a simple error.  Gullible.info was deliberately misled by Stephen Colbert, host of the wildly popular Colbert Report.Mr. Colbert, under the guise of \"discussing\" the nature of Wikipedia, goaded his loyal legions into editing pages about elephants to include a statement, which he said \"would be a real blow to the environmentalists.\"  Colbert even admits his information wasn't necessarily grounded in reality (as he said: \"I don't know if that's actually true\").  But what was the partisan lie he pushed?  You guessed it... \"The elephant population has tripled in the last six months.\"Readers: We have let you down, and for this our hearts ache. You turn to us for whimsey and fancy, but instead we gave you candies made of mud. In no way are we trying to avoid our deserved responsibility in this matter; had we been more precise in our practices this whole situation could have been avoided. On the other hand, would you stand by a man who poisoned our water supply as Mr. Colbert has poisoned our information supply? I wouldn't go as far as to use the phrase \"information terrorist,\" but that's what some insiders have been calling this little stunt.Stephen Colbert: shame on you. You have a duty to the American people you must uphold. After all, were you not the man who coined the word \"truthiness?\"-The Hardworking Team at Gullible.infoP.S., We have begun an internal review of our entire research and fact checking procedures, in case those in an information dissemination role, like Stephen Colbert, learn no lessons from all this.P.P.S., In addition to more rigorous , we will also be marking our dubious mistakes with this:Finally, and again, we are so sorry for this terrible mistake.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please ."

				"ContactWith the advances of medical science throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, more and more diseases of the ancient world have been conquered. But many diseases have been recently discovered, caused not by deadly pathogens but by contact with various mostly-innocuous substances. Here are a few samplings, from the the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention's \"Contact Syndromes To Beware Of In 2007\":Chronic Theobromic Bronchitis, also known as Chocolate Emphysema, is a syndrome rapidly gaining prevalence in the confectionary community. It results from the long-term inhalation of powdered cocoa during the manufacture of truffles and other sweets. This powder pollutes and irritates the lungs, causing unpleasant symptoms and raising the risk of lung cancer later in life. Its pathology is not unlike Pneumoconiosis (\"Black Lung\") which results from inhaled coal dust, and this similarity has led to the common appellation \"Brown Lung\". Though chocolate ingested in moderation acts as an antitussive, lungs contaminated in this way suffer from spasmodic contractions, and sufferers often report chest plain and bloody coughing. There is currently no known treatment, though limiting exposure to cocoa powder has been shown to halt the progress of symptoms.Acute Pyrotechnic Absorbative Psychosis, known better by its nickname \"Firecracker Madness\" was first discovered in a number of young Laotian fireworkwrights in 1989. A new pyrotechnic alkaline had just come into use in Southeast Asia, and these sixteen fireworks-makers all worked with the substance. They drew handfuls of it out of large buckets and packed it into skyrocket launch tubes for several hours each day. Unbeknownst to their employers, this substance was able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and soon these men found themselves the victims of terrifying hallucinations and delusions. One man became convinced his father was calling to him from heaven to bring large bales of toilet paper to the tallest hill in the village, another became convinced that he could pass through solid objects. A third fell fourteen meters from a catwalk, convinced he was being pursued by a ball of fire-breathing eels. After four days of inexplicable behavior on the part of their employees, factory managers shut down the operation, and after discovering the cause the use of the alkaline pyrotechnic was discontinued throughout Laos. Thirteen of the sixteen men stricken with the syndrome recovered fully, and the remaining three live on somewhat disabled to this day. The chemical (whose name and composition was never released) continues to be used by Chinese and Korean fireworks manufacturers, but they refuse to comment on any further cases of \"Firecracker Madness\". In 2005 a class-action suit was brought against General Mills, The Kellogg Company, and a number of other US breakfast cereal manufacturers. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants' cereals gave them what experts termed Acute Erosive Gingivitis, the sudden and severe erosion of gum tissue by the ingestion of abrasive breakfast cereal. \"Their teeth were quite literally eaten away by the sharp, dense material in a number of the defendants' products,\" said Dr. Miriam Feldman, a Gingivist with the National Gum Institute. \"It is as if they had been chewing nails.\" The high density and sharp cleavage patterns prevalent in these cereals acted as strong abrasives when consumed regularly, causing peridontitis and even tooth loss in as little as a year's time. The case was settled in early 2006 for an undisclosed amount, but the CDC cautions that the syndrome can still be developed, and to monitor gum health and visit a Gingivist regularly.In the early 1980s, the Islamic Republic of Turkey was shaken by an outbreak of foodborne bacterial dermatitis in what the Turkish press dubbed the Hummus Catastrophe. In the spring of 1981, a heavier than expected season of rain created an unforseen bloom in the naturally-occuring bacteria found in the roots of chick pea plants produced in Central Asia. These bacteria posed no threat to the human digestive tract, but when coming into contact with human skin during consumption the bacteria in the hummus began to act on the follicles much as it acted on the roots, causing severe skin irritation, and, if left untreated, dermal necrosis. Over 500 Turks were treated for moderate rashes, and eleven required skin grafts to replace damaged tissue. This incident led to worldwide legume sanitation reform, and no similar outbreaks have been reported since."
